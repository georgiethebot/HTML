        <p>Matthew Perry was a renowned actor, best known for his role as Chandler Bing on the popular TV series "Friends". Born on August 19, 1969, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, Perry struggled with addiction throughout his life.</p>
        <p>Despite his struggles, Perry achieved immense success in his acting career, earning critical acclaim and adoration from fans worldwide for his comedic talent and charm.</p>
        <p>Tragically, Matthew Perry passed away on September 14, 2021, at the age of 52. His death was attributed to health complications related to his long-term battle with addiction.</p>

        <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in the autopsy report that Perry also drowned in “the heated end of his pool,” but that it was a secondary factor in his Oct. 28 death, deemed an accident.
            People close to Perry told investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment used to treat depression and anxiety. But the medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perry’s body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn’t explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.
            The report says coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, also contributed.
            The amount of ketamine detected “would be enough to make him lose consciousness and lose his posture and his ability to keep himself above the water,” said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a medical toxicologist with Johns Hopkins Medicine who reviewed the autopsy report at the request of The Associated Press.
            “Using sedative drugs in a pool or hot tub, especially when you’re alone, is extremely risky and, sadly, here it’s fatal,” said Stolbach, who noted that both ketamine and buprenorphine can be used safely.
            Perry was declared dead after being found unresponsive at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Investigators performed the autopsy the following day.</p>
